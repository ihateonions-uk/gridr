# GridR
This is a simple to use CSS style-sheet offering a basic responsive grid that anyone can use regardless of coding skill. The download comes with an example file which only contains the grid you see below. For more column sizes and install instructions see the documentation.

Make sure you include the meta viewport tag and include the gridr.css style sheet to begin creating grids.

All grids start with a grid div tag which houses a row and block tag for the columns.

Feel free to use how you wish.
